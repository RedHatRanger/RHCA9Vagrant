# Using the Scientific Method for Troubleshooting

## Objectives
Learn to troubleshoot systematically using the scientific method.

## Overview of Troubleshooting as a Scientific Method
Troubleshooting effectively involves using the scientific method, which relies on logic to test and verify solutions step-by-step. This process helps avoid wasting time on unproven guesses, particularly for unfamiliar problems. Instead, the scientific method helps you come up with logical theories and test them until you find a solution.

## Steps of the Scientific Method for Troubleshooting
1. **Collect Information**: Gather all relevant facts. Ask questions about the issue, collect log files, and avoid relying on opinions. Make sure you fully understand the problem and try to reproduce it if possible.

2. **Create a Problem Statement**: Write a clear description of the problem, like a simple sentence that identifies:
   - What is not working?
   - When was the issue first noticed?
   - Who is affected?
   - Where does the issue occur?

3. **Formulate Hypotheses**: Based on the information collected, make a list of possible reasons for the problem. This is best done as a group. Each possible cause should also include how you plan to test it.

4. **Test Each Hypothesis**: Test each hypothesis one by one. Change only one thing at a time during each test and record the results. This helps you determine whether a specific change fixed the problem.

5. **Record and Analyze Test Results**: Keep track of your test results. If none of the tests identify the root cause, go back to brainstorming more hypotheses or seek more information about the system.

6. **Fix and Verify**: Once you identify the cause, apply a solution. Ensure each fix is tested thoroughly, one change at a time, to confirm it worked. Ideally, use a change management system to keep track of any changes made.

### Summary
The scientific method involves collecting information, writing a clear problem statement, coming up with possible causes, testing them, recording results, and applying fixes. This structured approach helps solve even complex problems logically and systematically.

## Example Problem Statements and Solutions

### Problem Statement 1
**Problem**: "Starting last Friday, all marketing department users are unable to launch the mail application. They receive an error message saying 'Data store XYZ is not available.' The issue can be consistently reproduced by selecting the mail icon from any marketing user's menu."

### Formulating Hypotheses
Based on the problem statement, possible hypotheses could include:
- **Data store XYZ is on a disk that failed**: Test by checking if you can locate and access other files on the same disk.
- **Data store XYZ is on a network share that no longer exists**: Test by locating the share and trying to access it directly using a proper client.
- **Data store XYZ is on a storage server that has stopped working**: Test by accessing the server using management tools to check if it's operational.
- **Network connectivity issues**: Test by checking network interfaces and using network tools to verify connections.

### Testing Hypotheses
- **Hypothesis 1**: Check if other files on the disk are accessible. If they are, the disk is not the issue.
- **Hypothesis 2**: Try accessing the network share directly. If it works, the problem lies elsewhere.
- **Hypothesis 3**: Use server management tools to verify if the storage server is functioning. If the server is fine, this hypothesis can be ruled out.
- **Hypothesis 4**: Use network diagnostic tools to check connectivity. If there is a network problem, troubleshoot and resolve that first.

### Recording and Analyzing Test Results
Upon testing, it was found that the network share is not reachable. This indicates that there might be an issue with the share setup or network permissions.

### Fixing and Verifying
- **Fix**: Reconfigure the network share settings to make it available again to users.
- **Verification**: After making the changes, test by having marketing users try to open the mail application. If they can open it successfully without error messages, then the problem is fixed.

### Result for Problem 1
**Solution**: "Currently, all marketing department users are able to successfully launch and use the mail application without any displayed error messages."

### Summary of the Example
In this case, the scientific method helped identify the root cause of the problem systematically:
1. **Information Gathering**: The error message and reports from users were collected.
2. **Problem Statement**: Users couldn't access the mail application due to "Data store XYZ" being unavailable.
3. **Hypotheses**: Several possible causes were listed, such as disk failure, network issues, or server problems.
4. **Testing**: Each hypothesis was tested until the issue was found to be a network share problem.
5. **Fix**: The network share was reconfigured, and access was verified.

This structured troubleshooting approach ensured the problem was solved efficiently and without unnecessary guesswork.
