# Lesson 7.2: Using auditd for System Auditing

## Objectives

- Learn how to configure and use `auditd` for tracking system changes and auditing activities.

## Introduction to `auditd`

The `auditd` daemon is the user-space component of the Linux auditing subsystem. When `auditd` is running, kernel-generated audit messages are collected in the audit log file (`/var/log/audit/audit.log`). If `auditd` is not running, kernel audit messages are sent to `rsyslog`.

By default, `auditd` logs certain messages such as authentication events, authorization messages when users log in or use `sudo`, and SELinux messages. Security administrators can also use `auditctl` to add custom auditing rules to track specific system activities, including file operations.

## Adding Audit Rules

### Importance of Rule Order

Audit rules work on a **first-match-wins** basis, which means that the order of rules is crucial for achieving the desired auditing behavior. For instance, if one rule logs access to all files in `/etc`, and a later rule logs access to all files in `/etc/sysconfig`, the second rule would not be reached because the first rule already covers it. Proper ordering allows both rules to function as intended.

### Watch Rules

A watch rule is one of the most basic types of audit rules. It can be set on specific files or directories, and configured for different access types such as read, write, attribute change, and execute. Watch rules trigger on the initial open system call that requests access, not on subsequent reads or writes.

#### Examples of Watch Rules

- To add a watch rule on `/etc/passwd` for write and attribute change access:

  ```bash
  auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k user-edit
  ```

  This command adds a custom key (`user-edit`) to all generated log messages, making them easier to filter.

- To add a recursive watch on the `/etc/sysconfig` directory for read, write, and attribute change access:

  ```bash
  auditctl -w /etc/sysconfig/ -p rwa -k sysconfig-access
  ```

- To audit execution of binaries under `/bin`:

  ```bash
  auditctl -w /bin -p x
  ```

  This rule audits any execution of binaries in the `/bin` directory.

## Removing Rules

- Use the uppercase `-W` option to remove a watch rule:

  ```bash
  auditctl -W /etc/passwd
  ```

- Use the lowercase `-d` option to remove rules added with `-a` or `-A`:

  ```bash
  auditctl -d -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S all
  ```

- To remove **all audit rules**, use:

  ```bash
  auditctl -D
  ```

## Persistent Rules

To make audit rules persistent across reboots, add them to the `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules` file. This file follows the same syntax as the `auditctl` command but excludes the `auditctl` command itself. Empty lines are allowed, and comments start with `#`.

### Loading Rules from a File

When the `auditd` service is started, it automatically loads all the rules from `/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules`. You can also use the `auditctl -R` command to manually load rules from a file:

```bash
auditctl -R /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
```

## **Note**: By design, `auditd` cannot be reloaded with `systemctl restart auditd`. Instead, use the `service auditd restart` command to reload changes to persistent rules while properly logging the UID of the user initiating the action.

## Reading Audit Messages

Audit messages are saved in `/var/log/audit/audit.log`. These messages contain various fields, each labeled for easy identification, which may differ depending on the message type.

### Example Audit Record

An example audit record looks like this:

```bash
type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1371716130.596:28708): arch=c000003e syscall=2 success=yes exit=4 a0=261b130 a1=90800 a2=e a3=19 items=1 ppid=2548 pid=26131 auid=500 uid=0 gid=0 euid=0 suid=0 fsuid=0 egid=0 sgid=0 fsgid=0 tty=pts0 ses=1 comm="aureport" exe="/sbin/aureport" subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 key="audit-access"
```

- `type=SYSCALL`: Indicates the message type.
- `msg=audit(1371716130.596:28708)`: Displays a timestamp and event ID. To convert the timestamp to human-readable form:

  ```bash
  date --date=@1371716130
  ```

- `auid=500`: Displays the original user ID.
- `uid=0`, `euid=0`: Shows the effective UID of the user who triggered the event.
- `comm="aureport"`: The command that triggered the event.
- `exe="/sbin/aureport"`: Path to the executable.
- `key="audit-access"`: An identifier for the event, useful for filtering.

## Searching for Events

The auditing system provides the `ausearch` tool to easily search and filter audit events. It can also translate numeric values into readable formats like usernames or system call names.

### Common `ausearch` Options

- `-i`: Interpret log entries into readable values.
- `--raw`: Print raw log entries.
- `-a <EVENT-ID>`: Show all entries for the given event ID.
- `--file <FILENAME>`: Include all events for a specific file.
- `-k <KEY>`: Search for events based on a specific key.
- `--start [start-date] [start-time]`: Include events after a specified start date and time. Use `--end` to specify an end time.

### Example Use of `ausearch`

To search for all events labeled with a specific key (`audit-access`) and interpret the results:

```bash
[root@host ~]# ausearch -i -k audit-access
type=PATH msg=audit(06/20/2013 10:15:30.596:28708): item=0 name=/var/log/audit inode=17998 dev=fd:01 mode=dir,750 ouid=root ogid=root rdev=00:00 obj=system_u:object_r:auditd_log_t:s0
type=CWD msg=audit(06/20/2013 10:15:30.596:28708): cwd=/root
type=SYSCALL msg=audit(06/20/2013 10:15:30.596:28708): arch=x86_64 syscall=open success=yes exit=4 a0=261b130 a1=90800 a2=e a3=19 items=1 ppid=2548 pid=26131 auid=student uid=root gid=root euid=root suid=root fsuid=root egid=root sgid=root fsgid=root tty=pts0 ses=1 comm=aureport exe=/sbin/aureport subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 key=audit-access
```

This command displays an interpreted version of audit logs filtered by the `audit-access` key value.
