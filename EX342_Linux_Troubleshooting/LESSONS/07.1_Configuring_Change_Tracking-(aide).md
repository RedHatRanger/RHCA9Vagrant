# Lesson 7: Configuring Change Tracking

## Objectives

- Implement change tracking to monitor system modifications using Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE).

## Using Intrusion Detection Software for Change Monitoring

Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) is a tool that compares and reports file and directory modifications. It can be used to monitor files for changes to permissions, ownership, timestamps, or contents. When changes are detected, they are logged in `/var/log/aide/aide.log`.

### Installing AIDE

To install AIDE, use the following command:

```bash
[root@host ~]# yum install aide
```

The `aide` package provides the `aide` utility, configuration files, and documentation for tuning the monitoring of specific changes of interest.

### Configuring AIDE

The main configuration file for AIDE is `/etc/aide.conf`. It has three types of configuration directives: configuration, selection, and macro.

- **Configuration**: Lines take the form `param = value`. When `param` is not a built-in AIDE setting, it defines a group that lists which changes to monitor. For example:

  ```
  PERMS = p+i+u+g+acl+selinux
  ```

  This line defines a group called `PERMS` that monitors changes in file permissions (`p`), inode (`i`), user ownership (`u`), group ownership (`g`), ACLs (`acl`), or SELinux context (`selinux`).

- **Selection**: Selection lines define which checks are performed on directories. For example:

  ```
  /dir1 group
  =/dir2 group
  !/dir3
  ```

  The first line checks `/dir1` and all subdirectories. The second line checks only `/dir2` (without recursion). The third line excludes `/dir3` and its subdirectories from monitoring.

- **Macro**: Macro lines define variables, such as:

  ```
  @@define VAR value
  ```

  `@@{VAR}` refers to the defined macro. Comments in `aide.conf` start with `#`.

### Manually Deploying AIDE

After configuring `aide.conf`, initialize the AIDE database and perform the initial scan of the file system.

#### Initializing the AIDE Database

To initialize the AIDE database, use the following command:

```bash
[root@host ~]# aide --init
```

This creates the database in `/var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz`. Rename it to `/var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz` to create the expected database name for AIDE checks:

```bash
[root@host ~]# mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz
```

**Warning**: To prevent unauthorized manipulation of the AIDE database, it is recommended to move or copy the database to a secure location between validation runs.

### Checking for File System Changes

After creating the database, use the `aide --check` command to compare the current state of the file system with the stored database:

```bash
[root@host ~]# aide --check
```

Any differences will be displayed, showing both the original file state and the new condition.

**Note**: Certain services, such as the `prelink` cron job, may modify files frequently. Either disable such jobs or learn to recognize benign changes.

### Automating File Integrity Alerts

Create a shell script that checks `/var/log/aide/aide.log` for alerts and sends an email notification if changes are detected:

```bash
if ! grep "Looks okay" /var/log/aide/aide.log &>/dev/null
then
  cat /var/log/aide/aide.log | /usr/bin/mail -s "AIDE Alert" user@host
fi
```

To automate file system checks, create a cron job in `/etc/cron.d/aide`:

```cron
# AIDE Checks and alert
*/2 * * * * root /sbin/aide --check & /root/aide_mon.sh
```

### Manually Updating the AIDE Database

To update the AIDE database with wanted changes to files, use the following command:

```bash
[root@host ~]# aide --update
```

Rename the new database for the next run of AIDE checks:

```bash
[root@host ~]# mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz
```

Verify that the database and the file system match:

```bash
[root@host ~]# aide --check
